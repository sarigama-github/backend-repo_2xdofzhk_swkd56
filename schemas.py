Database Schemas

Define your MongoDB collection schemas here using Pydantic models.
These schemas are used for data validation in your application.

Each Pydantic model represents a collection in your database.
Model name is converted to lowercase for the collection name:
- User -> "user" collection
- Product -> "product" collection
- BlogPost -> "blogs" collection

# Note: The Flames database viewer will automatically:
# 1. Read these schemas from GET /schema endpoint
# 2. Use them for document validation when creating/editing
# 3. Handle all database operations (CRUD) directly
# 4. You don't need to create any database endpoints!
